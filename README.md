Create a figma and replicate it using bootstrap and HTML elements

Peer Review: Xavier Hopkins: I enjoyed the aesthetic of Natalia's website. Her page was more interactive then you would expect, and she allowed the user to change the gif that plays in the background while you explore the website. All the text used is unique and you will certainly learn about natalia by reading everything the website has to offer. Verr Good!!
